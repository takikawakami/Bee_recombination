# Bee_recombination
This repos contains scripts used for reconstructing queen bee haplotypes by sequencing whole genomes of multiple drones of the queen, and for detecting crossover and gene conversion breakpoints.

### reconstruct_Queen_haplotype_v2.PB.R
This is an Rscript to reconstruct queen haplotype

### CO_NCO_Queen_Drone_postFIlter_v2.R
This is to concatenate LD blocks while filtering out unlikely NCOs

### CO_NCO_Queen_Drone_COcount_v1.R
This is to summarise the number of crossovers (COs) and non-crossovers (NCOs)

### CO_NCO_Queen_Drone_postFIlter_v4.R
This is a modified script of `CO_NCO_Queen_Drone_postFIlter_v2.R` to detect gene conversions and NCOs.
